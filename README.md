## Research Highlights:
#### COVID-19 identification from volumetric chest CT scans using a progressively resized 3D-CNN incorporating segmentation, augmentation, and class-rebalancing:
This article aims to evaluate the proposed 3D-CNN classifierâ€™s performance for identifying COVID-19 utilizing volumetric chest images, where the volumes have come from the same source. The recommended integral preprocessing in the proposed framework consists of segmentation, augmentations (both geometry- and intensity-based), and class rebalancing.  The experimental analysis confirms that the CNN classifierâ€™s training with the suitable smaller patches and progressively increasing the network size enhance the identification results. Furthermore, incorporating the lung segmentation empowers the classifier to learn salient and characteristic COVID-19 features rather than utilizing whole chest CT images, driving improved COVID-19 classification performance.
