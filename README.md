### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m currently a Graduate Assistant pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at **Florida International University**, Miami. I completed my B.Sc. in EEE from **Khulna University of Engineering and Technology**, Bangladesh.

My current research focuses on **large language models (LLMs)**, particularly **fine-tuning strategies**, **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** methods, and **LLM agents** for advanced reasoning and automation. I actively work with **Hugging Face Transformers**, **PyTorch**, with **Python** as my primary programming language. I'm passionate about building scalable, efficient, and generalizable AI systems, and I contribute to open-source initiatives in this space.  
I have also previously worked with **deep learning for medical imaging**.
