# Hello everyone, :wave:
My name is Md Tasnim Jawad. I am an undergraduate student from Bangladesh finishing my final year at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology. I am also an up-and-coming deep learning researcher. So far I have worked mostly on medical images. My primary tool for data processing is python and I am familiar with both Tensorflow and Pytorch frameworks. I have an obsession with AI and it drives me to learn more every day. I am a fast learner.

My Work Experience:
Various online courses were my first introduction to Deep Learning. I have been learning and practicing new skills to combat various challenges. Various blogs and online platforms like Kaggle have also been useful in learning the basics. In my University, apart from being an undergrad, I have been working as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Kamrul Hasan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=36WXELIAAAAJ&hl=en) for more than a year. A part of one of my incompleted project is highlighted below.

## Research Highlights:
## COVID-19 identification from volumetric chest CT scans using a progressively resized 3D-CNN incorporating segmentation, augmentation, and class-rebalancing
This article aims to evaluate the proposed 3D-CNN classifierâ€™s performance for identifying COVID-19 utilizing volumetric chest images, where the volumes have come from the same source. The recommended integral preprocessing in the proposed framework consists of segmentation, augmentations (both geometry- and intensity-based), and class rebalancing.  The experimental analysis confirms that the CNN classifierâ€™s training with the suitable smaller patches and progressively increasing the network size enhance the identification results. Furthermore, incorporating the lung segmentation empowers the classifier to learn salient and characteristic COVID-19 features rather than utilizing whole chest CT images, driving improved COVID-19 classification performance.[Full paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235291482100191X)

## Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks to diagnose Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia from microscopic images
In our approach, online random oversampling is applied to rebalance the dataset. Furthermore, in this paper, we have experimented with the performance of the various pretrained networks for different resolutions of input images, something not found in other studies performed on this ALL dataset. Five different well-known networks are trained with the processed images to build an ensemble classifier as it ensures better performance in the other domain of medical image classifications. The pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset have been adopted for all the networks to utilize the transfer learning policy. In the end, those five trained weights are ensembled employing soft weighted aggregation to obtain the final prediction.[Full paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235291482100263X)

## Associating measles vaccine uptake classification and its underlying factors using an ensemble of machine learning models
Missing values are imputed employing various approaches, and then several feature selection techniques have been applied to identify the crucial attributes for predicting measles vaccination. A grid search hyperparameter optimization technique has been applied for tuning the critical hyperparameters of different ML models, such as Naive Bayes, random forest, decision tree, XGboost, and lightgbm. The performance improved when the proposed weighted ensemble of the XGboost and lightgbm approach was adapted with the same preprocessing and recommended for measles vaccine utilization.[Full paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9524617)
